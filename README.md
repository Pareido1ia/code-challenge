This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Assuming you already have an environment set up using npm or yarn

In the project directory run:

### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`
OR
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

The app should open in browser.

Apologies if it's a bit rushed, but the challenge was fun.
I tried to document where I made assumptions.
Hopefully it all works for you :)
